# Mastering Factorials: Building a Factorial Calculator in Python

## Introduction:
Hey CSKids! Today, we're diving into the world of factorials - a fascinating concept in mathematics. We'll not only understand what factorials are but also build a nifty Factorial Calculator using Python. Get ready for some math-powered coding magic!

## Understanding Factorials:
A factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' (denoted as 'n!') is the product of all positive integers up to 'n'. For example, 5! (read as "five factorial") is equal to ``5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1``, which equals 120.

##The Factorial Calculator Program:
Let's write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number. Here's the code:

```python
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Get user input for the number
num = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Check if the input is non-negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}.")
```
## How the Program Works:

1. We define a recursive function factorial(n) that calculates the factorial of 'n'.
2. The base case of the recursion is when 'n' is 0 or 1, in which case the factorial is 1.
3. If 'n' is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument 'n-1' until it reaches the base case.


## Using the Factorial Calculator:
When you run the program, it prompts you to enter a non-negative integer. The program then checks if the input is valid and calculates the factorial.

## Example Output:

```vbnet
Enter a non-negative integer: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
```

## Conclusion:
By building a Factorial Calculator, you've not only delved into the world of factorials but also honed your coding skills in Python. Factorials have wide applications in mathematics and computer science, making this a valuable concept to understand.
